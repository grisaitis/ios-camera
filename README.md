# ML apps
This repo contains many apps (mostly React Native, some web) where I explore running neural nets on-device with the phone's camera as the model input. 

Things I'm using and learning about:
* React Native
  - the basics
  - camera access with [react-native-camera](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera/)
  - implementing bridge modules for communicating between native and RN's javascript engine
* [onnx.js](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxjs)
* WebAssembly (as a backend for onnx.js)
* WebGL
* WebViews
* progressive web apps


As for ML, I'm interested in 
* backends for running inference in various contexts (browsers, native apps, embedded systems) and
* model architectures and training strategies for producing "mobile-friendly" models (low memory, compute and power consumption).

I'm working on this during a 12 week retreat at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).
